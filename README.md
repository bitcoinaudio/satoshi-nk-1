Bitcoin Audio Playground
The Playground is where we discover sounds using the Bitcoin blockchain as a source. We take the Merkle root or Hash of a block and slice it up then feed it to an instrument using Tonejs https://tonejs.github.io/.
The sounds of the blockchain are insteresting to say the least. At most, hypnotic.
